Currently GamessQ works and has been tested on Mac OS X, Windows and Linux. The
standard configure scripts given will work for building it on any of those
three operating systems.

Prerequisites:

In order to build GamessQ you must have wxWidgets and any related dev packages
installed. wxWidgets can be acquired from <http://www.wxwidgets.org>. If
building for windows, wxWidgets must be compiled with support for Unicode.
The current code requires wxWidgets 3.0 or later.

Configuring GamessQ:

To configure GamessQ simply run:
./configure

If you have the wxWidgets libraries installed in a non-standard location run:
./configure --with-wx-config=/path/to/wx-config

Building GamessQ:

To build GamessQ, simply run:
make

Installing GamessQ:

To install GamessQ on Linux, run:
make install

To install GamessQ on Mac OS X, run:
./bundle.sh
This will make a GamessQ.app bundle that you can then drop into your
applications folder.

To install GamessQ on Windows, you can simply run it from the source folder, or
copy the executables and the icons directory to somewhere in your program
files.
