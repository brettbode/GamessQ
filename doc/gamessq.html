<h1>GamessQ Manual:</h1>
<h2>Key Features:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Runs on Mac OS X, Windows and Linux</li>
<li>Automatic execution of GAMESS jobs.</li>
<li>Advanced process management allowing the user to pause and resume jobs
without loosing data.</li>
<li>Backend daemon keeps the queue active even when you close the interface or
log out(Mac OS X and Linux).</li>
<li>Batch job operations. Every job operation can be done to multiple jobs at a
time, allowing you to more easily manage a large queue.</li>
<li>A command line interface allowing you to manage the entire queue without a
GUI (see the Man page for details)</li>
</ul>
<h2>A Quick Walkthrough:</h2>
<p>The first time you start GamessQ, you should be presented with a
configuration dialog. The most important things here are the spool directory
and the GAMESS path. Please note that the GAMESS csh scripts do not like spaces
or non-ASCII characters in the paths.</p>
<p><b>Spool Directory:</b> This is the location where gamessq will store all
its temporary data. Every time you add a job to the queue, the input file will
get copied here, and the output files will be stored here until the job is
removed from the queue.  Unless you have a good reason to change the location,
the default should work just fine for most people.</p>
<p><b>GAMESS Path:</b> This is the directory containing the GAMESS
executables. On Linux/MacOS X this is specifically the directory containing a
script called gms (see below for more information).</p>
<p>Now that you've set up a few things, you're ready to enqueue a few jobs. To
add jobs to the queue, you have a couple options. You can click the add button
on the left of the toolbar, or you can simply drag and drop into the window
(windows and linux) or onto the icon (Mac OS X). You will then be asked how
many processors you want to use for those jobs.</p>
<p>You can now close the GamessQ window, and go do something else, and your
jobs will be run in the background. GamessQ has a part of the program that runs
in the background (or as a tray icon in windows) that keeps the queue moving
even when you close the main window. Under Mac OS X and Linux your jobs will
keep going even when you log out.</p>
<p>Once a job is completed there are two different ways you can save it back to
a useful location. You can click Job&gt;Save to File, which will pop up a save
dialog where you can tell it where and under what name you want the file saved,
it will then save two (or three for some jobs) files: <i>filename</i>.log,
<i>filename</i>.dat and possibly <i>filename</i>.irc. You can also click
Job&gt;Save to Folder, which will save the output files to <i>JobName</i>.log,
<i>JobName</i>.dat, and <i>JobName</i>.dat, this option allows you to save the
output from multiple jobs at the same time.</p>
<h2>Batch Job Management</h2>
<p>One of the features of GamessQ is its ability to manage jobs in batches. You
can add multiple input files at a time, and you can also do any operation
(cancel, pause resume etc.) on multiple jobs at a time. Simply select multiple
jobs (Hold down the ctrl key) and you can perform an action on all of the
selected jobs.</p>
<h2>What to do if something fails</h2>
<p>If a job finishes with an error, or you don't get valid data the first thing
you should do is look at the job's log (select the job and click Jobs&gt;View
Logs). If the log is empty or won't come up, you probably have the GAMESS path
wrong, in which case you need to set it again. It is also possible that you are
having problems with GAMESS in which case, you need to look into what's wrong
with your GAMESS installation.</p>

<h2>Using GamessQ with your own build of GAMESS</h2>
<P>GamessQ expects to run gamess in the manner of the scripts included with
the pre-built binaries. In particular it runs the "gms" script at the path 
given in your GAMESS path preference. It also expects the output files (.dat,
.trj, etc) to be placed in the current working directory by the rungms script.
Again that is the default behavior of the rungms script included with the
pre-built binaries, but not the one in the source distribution. If you place 
your .dat, etc files somewhere else GamessQ won't be able to find them for the
copy output command. To use GamessQ with a binary you have built from the 
source distribution do the following:
<UL>
	<LI>Grab a copy of the <a href="http://www.msg.chem.iastate.edu/GAMESS/GamessQ/gms">gms script</a>.
	<LI>Edit the gms script to set the default GAMESS version to whatever
		you have chosen.
	<LI>Setup the <a href="http://www.msg.chem.iastate.edu/GAMESS/GamessQ/rungms">rungms script</a> to store the .dat, .trj, etc files in the
		current working directory (./) so they will go into GamessQ's spool
		directory.
	<LI>Setup the rungms script to generate proper hostlist's for 1-n
		processors, where n is normally the number of cores in the system you
		are running on.
