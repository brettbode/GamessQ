GamessQ is a queue manager GAMESS jobs. It allows the user to enqueue several
jobs which will be run automatically without any further user interaction.
GamessQ runs with a backend daemon so that even when the user closes the
program or logs out (under Linux and Mac OS X) the queue will remain active and
keep running the jobs.

GamessQ has a GUI interface which can be launched by either running games with
no arguments or with the -g option. It also has a command line driven interface
that allows the user to manage the queue without having an available graphical
interface.

For build instructions refer to the INSTALL file in this directory.

For further instructions on using GamessQ refer to either man page or the html
howto provided with GamessQ.
